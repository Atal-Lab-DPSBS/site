<h1>Our Curriculum</h1>
</div>

<p>The curriculum has been designed for a duration of 12 sessions, with one hour each session for a total of 12 hours. The time has been divided in a 1:1:4 ratio for revision, learning, and exploration of concepts by the students respectively (or 10 minutes + 40 minutes + 10 minutes each session). Revision will encapsulate conversations to strengthen the knowledge of the applications of previously taught topics. Students are given time to explore and learn about concepts of their liking, or pursue personal projects that deal with STEM disciplines. This division has been made to allow students to explore both epistemological and practical knowledge at the same time, which leads to better understanding of concepts. The curriculum is divided into groups of 3 sessions each, with the first week in each group being dedicated to seeing and mapping, the second week to understanding, and the third week to acting.</p>
